The <ColorModeContext.Provider> component wraps its child components and provides the colorMode object (which likely includes the toggleColorMode function) to all descendant components that are consumers of the ColorModeContext context.

By wrapping components with <ColorModeContext.Provider>, those components can consume the colorMode object and access the toggleColorMode function to manage the color mode of the application.

This pattern allows for the propagation of color mode information throughout the component tree without having to pass props manually at each level.
