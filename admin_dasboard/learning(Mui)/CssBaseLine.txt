The <CssBaseline> component is placed at the top level of the application component hierarchy, typically within the ThemeProvider component.

By including <CssBaseline> in the application, it ensures that consistent baseline styles are applied to all HTML elements, which helps in achieving a consistent look and feel across different browsers and devices.

The styles applied by <CssBaseline> serve as a foundation upon which the rest of the application's styles can be built, ensuring a more predictable and consistent styling experience.
